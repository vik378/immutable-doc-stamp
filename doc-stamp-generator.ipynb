    "Even though there are electronic signatures out there paper print-and-sign documents still have legal value however do lack means for protection from tampering.\n",
    "\n",
    "While signing a multi-page document, unless it is signed on every page - there is a risk of unapproved change to unsigned pages - when somebody prints a page that looks and feels the same but has slightly different contents and so makes it looked like you signed up for something that you actually have never seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce such risk / make such a tampering / forgery attack significantly more difficult one could add an electronic checksum on every single page of the to-be signed (printed-and-signed) document. The last page (with signatures) then may feature the same checksum + a QR code to facilitate checksum transfer for contents validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As documents sometimes feature a lot of formatting this method will work best with plain text or markdown serializations. The checksum stamp shall indicate what serialization method and checksum algorithm were used.\n",

    "\n",
    "You may replace the below example with own text to be protected. Please make a note of serialization method - this is important for whoever will try to check if the document was tampered."
